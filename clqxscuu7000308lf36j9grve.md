## Who made the Internet?

The idea of the internet had been around for quite some time, but there has been a lot of conflicting information about the actual origin of the internet. The question had always been "who made the Internet?" Some say it's the bells lab; others argue it's from MIT or Stanford; some people believe it was created by the United States Government or probably the French Government. But that does not really matter much now -or does it?

However, no matter where you check, two names seem to keep popping up "Vinton Cerf" and "Robert Kahn" who at time were prominent in the field of computer science. These two figures kept reappearing in many results around the invention of the internet. This is because they came up with the computer standard system of communication over a network known as the TCP/IP aka Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). Their invention later because the standard for how information is shared over connected networks.

## How does the Internet Connect?

The internet connects using the standard earlier mentioned: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP). The TCP is used to transfer information from one point to another between the software and the IP over a network. The IP maps the address of the sender and the receiver to make communication efficient. Although this has a set of rules that guides the transmission and communication, but we'll talk about that in another article.

Now that you have a fair idea of how the internet came to be (or so), let's see how the internet connects to your phone. Although, to have a clear idea of what really happens behind the curtain, we will need to put the technical jargons aside for now to be able to focus on the most basic explanation of the internet. Okay, let dive into it.

The INTERNET is actually a compound word that joins two words together: **INTER**connected **NET**work. So, what does that even mean? This means that the internet is simply a giant ball of interconnected network. Now, the question would be "what is a network?" A network is a group of connected computers. In the context of a connected computer, the connection could be in form of cables, Bluetooth, infrared (remember infrared?ü§≠), satellite or any medium that allows the computer to communicate with each other.

Communication between computers allows them to share resources and data. However, over time we discovered that we could harness the computer communication to send information across a large range (and across international borders). But there was an issue, the initial network connection was over a short range; between a few computers in the same building known as LAN (local area network) and within a range (typically a few building). So, how do we make this network communicate over a longer range?

The solution was that the computers are grouped to a network and the networks are grouped together -hence forming the interconnected network- as INTERNET.

## Difference between Web1, Web2, and Web3

The internet has gone through various changes and overhauling since the first web page was made in 1991. So, let's call the first website that was ever created (and those around the same time) Web 1.0.

When the internet was invented, the main idea was basically for put information on the web. So, this mean that the web 1.0 was basically a static website that has no interactivity i.e. you can react to things online, no animations of any sort, and it was basically a one-sided kind of web platform where you simply go to get information. Think of it like a Wikipedia page without any interactivity so to say; you just go there to read whatever is on the page today.

So, let's just say web 2.0 is a correction of the 1.0. Now, there is better JavaScript, nicer way to write CSS, and so cooler features had been added to HTML. So, the web2 revolution was about make the web interactive, where people can communicate and engage. This thus led to platforms like yahoo, Facebook, google talk, twitter and so on where people can create their own content, and engage others content as well. But not long, people realized the flaw in that too; there's no way to claim ownership of your content online.

The Web3 revolution is more about owning and content security. This process harnessed the power of the Blockchain technology that keeps record of everything done on it i.e. no one person can own the same thing at the same time because there is a digital signature at the time of creation which cannot be erased. This keeps track of everything and links everything on the network together in a chain of information block -so one is dependent on the other.

## Who Controls the Internet?

Currently, whether you choose to accept or not, the truth remains that government of each country controls the internet. Everything you do on the internet is controlled (one way or the other) by your government using a firewall.

Let's use the interconnected network explanation again here. Remember how we say that all computers (including phones, iot device, and every other device that connects to the internet) in a particular area are grouped together as a network and the networks across multiple areas are thus grouped together as a giant network? This giant network is then passed through a giant firewall\* which the government uses to block certain websites and other things.

However, there is a way around the government firewall by using a VPN\*. This helps to route the network away from the particular area to another area of choosing.

## Are you safe on the Internet?

Well, to large extent you are! However, security is still one of those things that the internet is yet to get right. This includes issues of data breach, denial of service attack, leaked private information etc. But many corporations and the government are constantly formulating policies and investing in gadgets and personnel that ensures you are as safe as they want to be...well, it's as they want you to be though.

You can read about trends in cyber security to have a fair idea about how safe you are online and how to keep yourself more secure.

## What is the Future of the Internet in the World of AI?

With the rise of larger and larger language models, machines are getting more data than any human could comprehend. However, I still personally feel the future of the internet is still considerably bright -although, most sci-fi movie will argue that we are now more at risk of the "rise of machine". But thank God for people like Elon Musk and some people from OpenAI who are constantly reminding us of the value of human and the reason to keep AIs in check.

## Key Takeaway

In the article, we explore an introduction to the internet and how the internet works. Here are some of the key takeaways:

* Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn built the first communication standard over networks known as the TCP/IP which became the standard for communicating over computer networks.
    
* The internet means "**Interconnected** **Networks**". This explains that the internet is a giant network consisting of smaller networks that connect to each other.
    
* A few computers in the same building that are communicating to each other over a network is known as LAN (local area network) and those communicating within a bigger range is known as WAN (wide area network).
    
* Web1 is all about static information without any interaction. By contrast, web2 is a buildup on web1 and thus allows communication, engagement, creating, and sharing. Web3 is mostly about rights to intellectual property and decentralization by using the Blockchain technology.
    
* Firewalls allow the government to sieve through the information the citizens can access thereby allow the government to control the internet of a control but this is easily prevented using VPN.`‚Å†`‚Å†
