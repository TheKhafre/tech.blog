Lately, the best advice anyone can give you (or maybe even give yourself) is "learn a tech skill!" The tech industry has been experiencing a lot of boom lately which has been inspring a lot of innovations. This article also aims to support the smooth transitioning of newbie into the world of tech. However, the tech road is not one that has gotten any easier; especially now that many are turning to AI.

Anyone would think that now that there seem to be endless resources and AI to assist, the transitioning into tech tech should be easier, but that is far from the truth. Some of the factors that are contributing to this includes:

* gatekeeping
    
* roadmap
    
* and the rise of AI
    

### Gatekeeping

according to the [Cambrigde English dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/gatekeep), "gatekeeping is the attempt to try to control who gets particular resources, power, or opportunities, and who does not." This attempt could go as far sharing wrong information with an intention to mislead; repeatedly sharing the bad part of the industry with intention to scare the newbie; withholding important points/resources that can help the newbies in the industry.

The case gatekeeping has been an age long practice that is aimed at reducing competition in a particular field. A way to escape gatekeeping is by identifying and follow-up on a mentor who will be able to guide you on challenges on your tech journey.

### Roadmap

One of the major challenge that beginners face when transitioning into tech is the problem around "what to do" and "how to do it". This is particularly common in this age of internet learning; all you need is an internet connection and you can start learning anything for free. But, with this age of open free information, you can easily fall into another trap which is the problem of "information overload" or "passive learning."

You are interested in picking on a tech career but you cant get a mentor and you are scared of information overload, so where do you start from and where do you go from here? the simple trick is to get a career roadmap for your chosen tech field. let's say for example you are interested in frontend, the roadmap could look something like this:

![frontend roadmap grabbed from braincandy.in](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1689859467126/5eb4fe12-1ba2-4100-ba8b-77c5e1f18ba0.jpeg align="center")

This is a ideal roadmap for anyone who wants to pick up the frontend stack. But, this is just one of many variations of the roadmap for going into the frontend stack, you can just check google for a style that you might find more interesting and appropriate for you. Please note, I only used the frontend stack as an example, you can get the roadmap for literally any tech stack that interests you.

After getting the right roadmap for your desired tech stack, now you can move ahead to look for learning resource. This roadmap will help guide your learning path and serve a form of virtual teacher to prevent you from information overload.

*A tip I would advice though is that "until you are done with a concept, dont move to another."*

### Dealing with AI

Google, Microsoft, and other bigcorp have all insinuated introducing an assistive AI on the internet but none did until OpenAI released the ChatGPT. OpenAI's GPT would go on to revolutionize the way everyone use the internet and today there are over a thousand Assistive AI on the internet (including Google's Bard and Microsoft Bing AI).

However, instead of making learning easier for tech enthusiasts it made it a lot harder because now you need to prove why you are better than an AI to an employer. Although, while this seems like an existential crisis for an average developer (especially for a junior/noob developer), AI only feed on already available resources on the internet. What this simply means is that a person will always be more original than AI, hence, you need to prove your originality.

For a start, as a beginner techie the AIs can provide a lot of help and support in your journey. You can use it for things like understanding concepts better and learning resources recommendation.

All of this concepts and suggestions are just a few ways to start your journey into the ever-expanding world of tech, maybe you will be the next Elon Musk or make Amazon better; I look forward to see you shine.
